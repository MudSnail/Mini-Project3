LHL Labs mini-project


The Story Want:
    - Focus on age groups and genders and compare with spending habits
    - Important to understand the demographics
    - What the banks cilental is like


What we want to do:
    - Already updated our demographic table (update_customers.csv)
    - Join demo table to Accounts
        - Clean up table, group, etc
        - EDA with our demo
        - Clustering
    - Join demo table to transactions
        - use subtable so we can create a new column in transactions on savings, credit or checking type
        - Clean up table, group, etc
        - EDA with our demo
        - Clustering


After we can talk about:
    - visualize the created clusters using [radar charts](https://plotly.com/python/radar-chart/) and compare them agains each other
    - visualize segmentations using scatter plot. We will have to use PCA to be able to plot our observations in 2D.
